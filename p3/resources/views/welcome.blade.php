    <dt>Ends</dt>
    <dd>An "end" is simply a group of arrows shot at the target.  For our purposes, an <em>untimed end</em> always has six arrows.  A <em>timed end</em>  has a specific time limit, but you can shoot as many arrows as you like, so long as you do so safely.</dd>
    <dt>Scores</dt>
    <dd>At any point, an archer or guest may shoot an end, and say to themself "I wanna record that!".  They can enter that score into ASK by putting in the points scored, the distance, and whether the end was timed.</dd>
